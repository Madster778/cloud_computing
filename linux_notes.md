## What is Linux?

Linux is an open-source, Unix-like operating system kernel that serves as the foundation for many different operating systems, commonly called "Linux distributions" (e.g., Ubuntu, Debian, CentOS, Arch).

- It's widely used in servers, embedded systems, mobile (Android), and cloud environments.
- Known for its security, flexibility, and developer-friendliness.

## A Short History of Linux

- **1991**: Created by Linus Torvalds as a personal project while studying at the University of Helsinki.
- Inspired by Unix and released under the GNU General Public License (GPL).
- Grew rapidly thanks to global collaboration and contributions from developers.
- Today, it powers everything from smartphones and web servers to supercomputers.

## Why is Linux Popular â€“ Especially for Production Servers?

- **Open source**: Free to use, modify, and distribute.
- **Stability**: Can run for months or years without rebooting.
- **Security**: Lower attack surface and strong permission system.
- **Performance**: Efficient and lean, great for high-traffic servers.
- **Customization**: Choose only what you need; full control.
- **Community Support**: Extensive documentation and forums.

## Advantages of Linux

- Free and open source
- Secure and stable
- Wide hardware compatibility
- Highly configurable
- Strong command-line tools
- Frequent updates without reboot

---

## Disadvantages of Linux

- Steeper learning curve (especially CLI)
- Limited support for some proprietary software (e.g. Adobe)
- Gaming and specialised software support is weaker than Windows
- Can require manual configuration (depending on distro)

Most web servers (e.g., Apache, Nginx), databases (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL), and cloud platforms run on Linux.
