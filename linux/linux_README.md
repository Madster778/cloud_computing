## System Information and Shell Basics

Before starting any task, it's good practice to check your system and user context:

```bash
whoami            # Shows current user
uname             # Displays system information
uname --help      # Lists uname options
cat /etc/shells   # Shows available login shells
```

## Package Management

Linux packages are managed via `apt` on Debian-based systems like Ubuntu:

```bash
sudo apt update -y       # Update list of available packages
sudo apt upgrade -y      # Upgrade all installed packages
sudo apt install tree -y # Install the tree command
tree                     # View a folder as a directory tree
```

## Bash Scripting: Automated EC2 Setup with NGINX

To speed up provisioning, we created a Bash script that installs and configures NGINX on a fresh Ubuntu EC2 instance.

**Script: `install_nginx.sh`**

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# update
sudo apt update -y

# upgrade
sudo apt upgrade -y

# install nginx
sudo apt install nginx -y

# restart nginx
sudo systemctl restart nginx

# enable nginx
sudo systemctl enable nginx
```

### How to Use:

1. Create the file:

   ```bash
   nano install_nginx.sh
   ```

2. Make it executable:

   ```bash
   sudo chmod +x install_nginx.sh
   ```

3. Run the script:
   ```bash
   ./install_nginx.sh
   ```

Once complete, NGINX will be installed, running, and configured to restart on boot.

### Check NGINX Status

```bash
sudo systemctl status nginx
```
